# Methodological Quality and Reporting of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) in Sports Sciences: A Scoping Review
Originally, this is the repository for the manuscript _"Methodological Quality and Reporting of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) in Sports Sciences: A Scoping Review"_ that is submited in the 
journal [xxx](https://www.xxxxx). The aim is to map the existing literature on this topic, identify research gaps, and provide an overview of the available evidence. By doing so, we seek to inform best practices in GLMM reporting and foster a more rigorous approach to their use in sports research.
